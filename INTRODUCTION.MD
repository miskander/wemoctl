# Introduction

## Why does this PR even exist?

Hi, I've read your tweet on the opportunity as Senior Engineering Manager - Actions and GitHub Package Registry.
I wanted to introduce myself.
I’ve recently read "There is no such thing as long copy, only boring copy” so I’ll do my best.

## Who are you?

My name is Santiago Esteva, I lead the web and mobile architecture teams at Sabre - travel industry catering to airlines and airports across the world - where we help dev teams move into web and mobile platforms.

In our organization, we are all hands-on. No ivory tower. We have experience and scars, we share our knowledge and help side by side implementing the solution to the challenge in front of us.

## Ok, I'll entertain this...

During this five years process, we were able to successfully migrate 40+ large applications using React, React Native, ios/android on the client and Java-based on the backend. The company has its strong suit on Java profiles.

Over this transformation, I've led two teams of Principal and Tech Lead engineers distributed across Bangalore, Krakow, Montevideo and Dallas. I have been very fortunate to have this group working with me without suffering any attrition.

Depending on each transformation relevance for the company’s strategy, I would also take over the project from inception to release handling both technical and management aspects of it. Depending on the project’s size this meant managing 2 to 10 teams of full-time employees and/or contractors across multiple locations.

## So any experience on package management?

After the first project, we realized we needed to provide teams with some kind of boilerplate and library of reusable components to reduce dev time. As a first step, we set up/maintained Sinopia as our internal package registry. Until this point, the company supported Java packages only.

As we transformed more applications and adoption scaled, we moved to Nexus to have synergies across all stack. Eventually, we supported Docker as well. Later on my take took on setting up the CI/CD for all apps leveraging Teamcity and we are currently moving into Jenkins to reduce license costs and scale on the cloud. We are currently helping the company move to Openshift.

The teams are now mature, we have defined the reference architecture, built a community around it and provided the company with a clear path towards the goal. I am now looking for the next challenge ahead.

I believe all of these qualities and experiences contribute directly to the core components of this particular position, and that's why I'm excited about the opportunity to work at Github.

Note: I would appreciate if you could delete this PR so as to avoid people eventually finding it. If you are interested in getting to know me, please contact me @sesteva or via Linkedin.

Thank you - Santiago Esteva
